# ✅ Check-in: Universal Presence Verification System
> 🚀 **Current Status:** MVP Phase (Preparing for Deployment)

## 🎯 Project Overview
A secure, evidence-based competency portfolio platform aimed at solving attendance fraud. The system utilizes Dynamic QR codes and GPS validation to capture trusted data, transforming raw attendance logs into a verified, 3-tier professional skill portfolio for students.

## 👥 Team & Responsibilities
